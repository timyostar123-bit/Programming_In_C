Q104: Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that 
the sum of all elements between 1 and x inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. 
Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1. 
Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.

Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
n = 8
Output 1: 6

Input 2:
n = 1
Output 2: 1

Input 3:
n = 4
Output 3: -1
*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter n: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // total sum from 1 to n
    int totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;

    int pivot = -1;

    // Check each x from 1 to n
    int leftSum = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        leftSum += x;  // sum from 1 to x
        int rightSum = totalSum - (x - 1) * x / 2;  // sum from x to n

        if (leftSum == rightSum) {
            pivot = x;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", pivot);

    return 0;
}
